"""One-off diagnostic: verify the 2024-01-01 historical backfill (see scripts/backfill_2024.py)
actually landed complete, gap-free data for every in-scope bidding zone - not just that
MIN(valuetime)/MAX(valuetime) look right, since days can be missing in between those two points.

Read-only: only SELECTs against prod.prices, never writes. Run manually:
`poetry run python scripts/verify_backfill.py`.

Checks, per (bidding_zone, market):
  1. Existence - every delivery day from 2024-01-01 to yesterday has at least one row from
     ANY source (redundancy/2-source coverage is a live-operation goal, not a backfill
     requirement - see project-overview.md > Goal).
  2. Completeness - days that do have rows have the FULL expected settlement-period count for
     that day (span of the delivery day in UTC, DST-aware, divided by that day's resolution),
     not just a partial scrape.
  3. Correctness sanity - no NULL price/resolution/currency, resolution in the known-valid set,
     no wildly-out-of-range prices.

Delivery-day boundary uses Europe/Copenhagen, same anchor as every other cross-cutting script
in this repo (monitoring/day_ahead_completeness.py).
